# nnTRF - neural network Temporal Response Function

This package is an artificial neural network implementation for temporal responses function modelling of brain signal. It not only implement linear time-invariant TRF which can be solved with ridge regression ([mTRF-Toolbox](https://github.com/mickcrosse/mTRF-Toolbox), [mTRFpy](https://github.com/powerfulbean/mTRFpy)) or boosting ([Eelbrain
](https://github.com/christianbrodbeck/Eelbrain)), and also implement the [dynamic TRF](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.26.609779) framework, and more!
